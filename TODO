\ jpeg2ascii
	shrink image
	foreach pixel
		get pixel using canvas

	learn how to decompress jpeg or bitmap?

\ '|' and '>' operators
	identify and treat special cli operators

\ getopt
	works right now, but probably a superset of what getopt should be doing

\ re-write mapping of commands to execution steps (modules or functions)
	JsTerm assumes control and JsTerm.Program.Bash dies?
	commands like history shouldn't be independent programs

\ execute for other contexts
	don't tie execution of a program to cli...allow other programs to call
	a program and handle its output

\ de-couple view from model
	assumptions that html will provide the UI should be removed.
	possibly use xHtml extensions for the UI

\ add more test data to filesystem

\ jsterm-mountfs to load saved data

\ js method to convert binary data to base64?
