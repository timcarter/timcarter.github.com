        <h1>I understand you have questions.</h1>
        
        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        
        <p>This site was made by <a href="http://jcoglan.com">James Coglan</a>.
          I write open-source software for the Web.</p>
        
        <h2>Why should I trust you?</h2>
        
        <p>This site does not store or transmit any data you enter into it; the
          information you type in never leaves your computer. It contains no
          analytics scripts, tracking cookies or other pieces of spyware. The
          passwords it generates are much more secure than most people use,
          against brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks and password database
          theft.</p>
        
        <p>According to <a
          href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html">Dropbox&rsquo;s
          zxcvbn password strength measure</a>, if your dictionary English
          password takes about a second to crack, those generated by Vault take
          over a million times the age of the observable universe to crack by
          brute force.</p>
        
        <h2>Fine, but I still don&rsquo;t trust you.</h2>
        
        <p>And why should you, after all I am just some guy from the Internet.
          However, this software is open-source (released under the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>)
          and you can <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/vault">take a look at
          its source code</a>. The site is a few simple static files that anyone
          is free to host themselves.</p>
        
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        
        <p>It takes your passphrase and a service name and generates a hash from
          them using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>.
          It then encodes the bits of this hash using a 94-character alphabet,
          subject to the given character constraints. This design means that
          each password is very hard to break by brute force, and ensures that
          the discovery of one service&rsquo;s password does not lead to other
          accounts being compromised. It also means you can tailor the output to
          the character set accepted by each service. The use of a deterministic
          hash function means we don&rsquo;t need to store your passwords since
          they can easily be regenerated; this means there&rsquo;s no storage
          to sync or keep secure.</p>
        
        <h2>What can I use as my passphrase?</h2>
        
        <p>Absolutely any text you like. A good passphrase should consist of a
          few words you can easily remember but would be hard to guess, like a
          quotation or a song lyric.</p>
        
        <p>Using a few words rather than some string of letters and numbers
          makes it easier for you to remember but harder for attackers to guess.
          But, many online services restrict the characters you can use, making
          you less safe. This tool lets you convert your passphrase into
          something each service will accept.</p>
        
        <h2>What should I use as a service name?</h2>
        
        <p>Again, this can be anything you like, it simply serves to modify your
          password and make it unique for every site you visit. Personally, I
          use the name of the site, as one word in lowercase, e.g.
          <tt>gmail</tt>.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to make sure your password is completely unique, that is
          make sure that even if you and someone else have the same master
          passphrase and use the same service, you get different generated
          passwords, you can prefix the service name with your username, e.g.
          <tt>bob@gmail</tt>.</p>
        
        <p>I also use a scheme to organise facets of a single group of passwords,
          for example at work I use <tt>songkick:ldap</tt> to log into our
          internal network, and <tt>songkick:blog</tt> to log into our Wordpress
          blog.</p>
        
        <p>The important thing is that it be something easy to remember based on
          the name of the site. If you forget your passphrase or the service
          name, Vault cannot recover your password for you.</p>
        
        <h2>How am I supposed to remember the character settings for each
          service?</h2>
        
        <p>I&rsquo;m working on that. In the mean time: just write them down.
          Unlike passwords, this information is public knowledge so it&rsquo;s
          totally safe to keep them in a file on your desktop or a piece of
          paper in your wallet.</p>
        
        <h2>Is there a command line version?</h2>
        
        <p>Of course there is. If you have <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a>
          installed, run <tt>npm install -g vault</tt>. You&rsquo;ll also want
          to take a look at the <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/vault">readme</a>.</p>
