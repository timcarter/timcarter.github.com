title: Dijkstra's algorithm
---

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that calculates the shortest path between an origin node and all the other nodes in the graph. The algorithm assumes that the each edge in the graph has a non-negative cost associated with traversing it.

The algorithm begins by assigning initial travel costs to all nodes in the graph. The origin node has a cost of zero while all other nodes are assigned a cost of infinity, as their true cost has not yet been calculated. The origin node is then inserted into a structure that is used to keep track of nodes that have not been processed. In most implementations this structure is a min-priority queue.

The node in the structure with the lowest associated cost is chosen to be processed. Initially, that node is the origin node. The cost of traveling from the origin to each of the current node's neighbors is then calculated. This cost is the cost of the current node plus the cost of the edge between the current node and neighbor. If this newly calculated cost is less than the cost currently associated with the neighbor, it is assigned to the neighbor. The neighbor is then added to the structure so that it can be processed later.

Once all the neighbors' costs have been calculated, the current node is marked as processed. It will never be visited again during the current run of the algorithm. Choose the next node to be processed from the structure-- this node should have the lowest associated cost among all nodes within the structure. Repeat the process described in the paragraph above.

Once the structure contains no more nodes, the algorithm has completed. All nodes in the graph should now have associated with them the lowest travel cost from the origin. It is now possible to compute shortest paths between specific nodes by working backwards from the destination and comparing the edge costs all the way to the origin.
